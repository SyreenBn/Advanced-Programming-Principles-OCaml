(* I work with Shawn. We discuss about [perimeter], [matrix_scalar_add] 
and [is_matrix]. I chose perimeter because it doesnâ€™t return the right answer. 
It was returning 14. I asked him to check what is the wrong of it and he told me. 
Also, he was wondering how I built the function with one method and I explained 
the algorithm to him. We add the situation if the element of list is the last element 
and it works [  |(x,y)::[]->  (distance (1.0,1.0) (x,y)) ]. 
Also I realized that I use List.length in is_matrix but I should not do that. So we 
discuss about how to build your length list and I rebuilt it again correctly. The last thing 
we discuss about matrix_scalar_add. He asked me what is the wrong of his function. 
It used to have some mistake in the order of call method command. Also, I tried to 
make perimeter more general but I could not. *)
